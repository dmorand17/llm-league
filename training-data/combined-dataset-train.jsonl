{"instruction": "Provide information about getting a street repaved", "context": "The user\u2019s street has numerous potholes and deteriorating pavement and they want to know how to request repairs.", "response": "For street repaving requests, our city uses a systematic assessment and scheduling process: 1) Submit a request through our Street Maintenance Request Form at [city].gov/street-repair, our mobile app, or by calling (555) 876-1234, 2) A Public Works inspector will evaluate the street condition within 2-4 weeks and assign a condition rating, 3) Streets are then prioritized based on condition rating, traffic volume, and proximity to key facilities like schools and hospitals. Our city repaves approximately 80 miles of streets annually based on this evaluation system. The current average wait time is 1-3 years depending on the street\u2019s priority score, though dangerous potholes are addressed separately through our pothole repair program within 48-72 hours of reporting. If your street has multiple potholes needing immediate attention, please report those specifically while your repaving request is processed. You can check the status of street projects, including the 5-year paving plan, on our website at [city].gov/street-projects."}
